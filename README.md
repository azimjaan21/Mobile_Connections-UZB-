This project visualizes the distribution of mobile connections in Uzbekistan from 2020 to 2025 by technology using the `pygal` library in Python.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to create a clear and informative pie chart that illustrates the share of different mobile connection technologies (2G, 3G, 4G, 5G) in Uzbekistan over the period from 2020 to 2025. 
The `pygal` library is used to generate the chart, which can be rendered in a web browser.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `pygal`: This library is used to create the chart.
- `lxml`: This is required by `pygal` for SVG rendering.

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pygal lxml
